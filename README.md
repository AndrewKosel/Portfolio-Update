# Portfolio

## Description 

This project is a series of web pages to show case my personal portfolio that can be used to introduce my self to others. The purpose of creating these websites is to show case my ability to leverage the grid system and build out functional websites using mostly Bootstrap and a little css. Each page is device responsive and allows users across any device to view and access a website that has a friendly UI/UX.
